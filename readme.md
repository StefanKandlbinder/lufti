# Lufti

... is a simple PWA built with [StencilJS](https://stenciljs.com/) to fetch air pollution data of a specific sensor from [Luftdaten Info](https://luftdaten.info/).

## Getting Started

The app is hosted free by Netlify and can be reached under this link: [https://sleepy-raman-4d9d6e.netlify.com/](https://sleepy-raman-4d9d6e.netlify.com/).

Just put in your Sensor ID and you will get the latest data from the server.
